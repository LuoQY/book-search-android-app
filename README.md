This Android-based application takes the search terms from users to retrieve the relevant book information from Google Books API by sending HTTP requests. The book information contains full book title, author names, publishers and cover pictures. The user behavioral data is stored in the MongoDB Altas and presented in a dashboard website deployed on the Heroku cloud platform.
